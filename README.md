### Description

Dating application that has users sign up and take a personality quiz. Based on the results of that personality quiz, a user is assigned a "color token". Based on the color token you can see some key attributes about your personality based on your quiz results and see other users assigned color tokens. Using the color token system along with other information provided by a user you can choose to follow someone you think you may be compatible with.
Users can like or follow each other and once that connection is made, they have the ability to message. You cna browse users by color token or zodiac along with view all users.
